# circleSpace-Project


This is a game i developed myself using common html5 tools 


first page is the homepage that shows a red ball that moves like a heartbeat.

clicking newgame allows the game to commence.


THE SETUP:

The game is about moving the circkle through the maze while you avoid touching the wall of the maze..

Upon reaching the end of the maze you see a welcome page that informs you about the rules of the game and how to survive, while you advance in the game you meet new obstacles and are expected to reach the maximum numbers of point i'll be including very soon.

number of points == how many times you sucefully move the circle through the maze and all the levels.
